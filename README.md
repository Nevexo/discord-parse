# discord-parse

A simple, rather shoddy parser for your Discord data export.

You can create an export in the Discord client, it takes forever to arrive though.

## Usage

> discord-parse requires Python 3.6+

### Install dependencies

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Export Discord data

Once your export arrives, extract all the directories into the 'export' directory in this project, if it doesn't exist, create it.

### Run!

`python3 report.py html`
